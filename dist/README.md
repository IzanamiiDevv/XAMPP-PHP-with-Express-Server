# Project Overview
This file provides an overview of the project.

# Note to Users
This project utilizes Node.js and the pkg module to compile the code into an executable file. This approach is designed so that you, as well as any other viewer with this project file do not need to download any additional applications for it to function.

Please be aware that certain files in this directory are currently deemed unnecessary after the compilation of the code. It's important to note that the code in these files cannot be altered. The developers have intentionally retained these files to help you or any viewer understand the application's structure.

However, please note that you can still update the code by recompiling the application. To do so, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. After installing Node.js, navigate to the project directory using the Terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

pkg package.json --output lunch --target node14-win-x64

This will recompile the application with the updated code.

However, it's crucial to emphasize that the developer strongly advises against altering any of the contents to prevent potential errors or bugs that could compromise the application's functionality. The recompilation option is provided for updating purposes only, and any modifications should be approached with caution to maintain the stability of the application.
